# Prediction-Using-Supervised-ML
This is my first task during my intership in Data Science &amp; Business Analytics at The Sparks Foundation where the problem statement is to predict the percentage of a student based on the number of study hours and to calculate the predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hours/day. In this task, i used python with scikit learn library for machine learning to implement the regression function. This is a simple Linear regression task as it involves only 2 variables.
